# Question

What are the regional trends for the percentage of the population prescribed drugs for anxiety, depression and psychosis in Scotland over the last ten years? What might these mean for employers' allocation of support resources? The next sections follow the Health Data Science Workflow to address these questions.

# Data Acquisition

The data was downloaded from <https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/> on 05/11/23 for the item "population prescribed drugs for anxiety/depression/psychosis" for all available years and all health boards. The downloaded file was called timetrend_data.csv and for the purposes of this question, it was renamed adp_data

```{r Step 1: Data Acquisition}
#reading in the data:
adp_data <- read_csv(here("Inputs/timetrend_data.csv"))
glimpse(adp_data)
```

#Prepare/Clean Data

```{r Step 2: Prepare/Clear}
# There are no missing values
# This chunk is for selecting and renaming columns, removing the rows for the whole of Scotland and removing the NHS prefix.
# The mutate line was suggested by chatgpt when I gave it the preceding lines in this chunk and asked it what to add to strip out the "NHS " prefix. 
plot_data <- adp_data %>%
  select('area_name','year','numerator') %>% 
  rename(number = 'numerator',NHS= 'area_name') %>% 
  filter(NHS !='Scotland') %>% 
  mutate(NHS = sub("^NHS ","", NHS))
head(plot_data)

```

#Analyse 14 Health Boards are too many to plot in the same visualisation; the audience would be overwhelmed. So, I will create a new column, classifying neighbouring NHS boards into Central Belt, Borders, Highlands and Islands and North East. Then, I have to sum the old NHS Board percentages for each year into a single value for the Region for that year.

```{r Step 3: Analyse}
#I wanted to use functions from the course but when I looked up how to recategorise a categorical variable, all the answers were using functions we hadn't used. So, I asked chatgpt. First, it advised a statement for each NHS Board but I knew it could be done in groups and using | or %in% so I modified the prompt. 
plot_data <- plot_data %>% 
  mutate(Region = case_when(
    NHS %in% c("Ayrshire & Arran" , "Borders" , "Dumfries & Galloway") ~ "Borders",
    NHS %in% c("Fife" , "Forth Valley" , "Greater Glasgow & Clyde" , "Lanarkshire" , "Lothian") ~ "Central Belt",
    NHS %in% c("Grampian" , "Tayside") ~ "North East",
    NHS %in% c("Highland" , "Western Isles" , "Orkney" , "Shetland") ~ "Highlands & Islands"))

#Now to calculate the regional percentages
summed_data <- plot_data %>% 
  group_by(Region, year) %>% 
  summarise(people = sum(number))
```

```{r Step 4: Communication}
options(scipen = 999)
summed_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = people, fill = Region))
```
